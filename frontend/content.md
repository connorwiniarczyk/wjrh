# About Us
  
Broadcasting from Hogg Hall since 1946, WJRH has been a major part of life on Lafayette College’s campus and beyond in the Lehigh Valley community. We provide the soundtrack to the Lafayette experience and make our voice heard by the greater community. You can listen to us 24/7 every day of the year on 104.9 FM in the area.

WJRH is one of the last college radio stations in the United States that is fully student managed and provides fully freeform programming. This means that we give 100% control to live DJs in the booth without any intervention or guidance from the Music Director. Freeform radio stations have always been at the forefront of the music world and we believe that we can achieve better programming through diversity.

WJRH is an all volunteer radio station. None of our members are paid for their efforts. The majority of WJRH’s funding comes from Lafayette College with additional funding from individual donors and funding programs. We offer the opportunity for Lafayette students and community members to learn about music, radio engineering, audio production techniques, electrical engineering, acoustics, podcasting and how to manage a small business.

WJRH is a federally licensed FM station owned by the Lafayette College Board of Trustees, operating at 104.9 MHz. You can tune into our signal from most of the Lehigh Valley 24 hours a day. WJRH is a noncommercial educational radio station meaning that we never air commercials.

## History

Radio Lafayette was established in 1946 on the third floor of Hogg Hall at Lafayette College. It was assigned the call letters WJRH in May of 1947; while W was the standard, JRH was in honor of James Renwick Hogg, the donor of Hogg Hall.

To the left, you see the original WJRH members, Raymond DePuy, Jerome B. Alenick, and George Menkart testing the station’s broadcasting capabilities, shortly after the radio was assigned call letters. The first official broadcast of WJRH took place five months later on October 1st, 1947. This broadcast was entitled “Songs at Seven” and aired various popular songs from 7 to 11 pm. Shortly thereafter, WJRH started broadcasting collegiate sports, with the first broadcast occurring on October 6th of that same year, eventually leading up to a regularly scheduled sports broadcast starting in Fall of 1948. In 1949, variety programming began, populating the schedule with quiz shows and talk radio.

From these humble beginnings, WJRH’s diversity in programming has expanded immensely. Over the years, WJRH has added a full recording studio, support for podcasting, and a community of people who love everything about sound. WJRH has hosted many artists, from As I Lay Dying and Ben Folds to more up-and-coming acts like Børns. In addition to artists, WJRH boasts a diverse and talented group of both student and community DJs who help to contribute to the Lafayette College soundtrack. We pride ourselves in serving both the student body of Lafayette and the City of Easton by championing free speech and providing a unique free-form listening experience. Since 2011, WJRH has been streaming online at WJRH.org; we at WJRH are honored and excited to continue WJRH’s proud past as a vital part of the Lafayette experience.


## Joining Us

One way to join WJRH is to become a DJ on the radio station. In the beginning of every broadcasting season (Spring, Summer and Fall semesters at Lafayette College) our program director solicits requests to become a DJ in the station through Lafayette College campus wide email lists as well as the general WJRH interest list. You may subscribe by sending a blank email to wjrh-join@mailman.lafayette.edu and follow the confirmation information sent to you.

You can join the station as a DJ anytime, however, in the beginning of every season when the schedule is reset, we hold a general body meeting to quickly collect time slot requests and sort out any questions DJs might have. Because of this, if you are considering to join the station in the beginning of a semester, we ask you to attend this meeting, typically held in the second week of every semester. If we are past the general body meeting of the season, please contact the program director and check if there are any timeslots available to you.

New schedules are publised in the beginning of every season on our website and shows start typically on the second weeks on Summer and Spring and on the third week of the Fall semester. Exact semester schedules can be found on the Lafayette College website.

The next general body meeting will be held on Thursday, January 26th, 2016 at 8PM in the Jaqua Auditorium (Room 103) in the Hugel Science Center. If you are not a Lafayette College student, we can easily arrange accomodations and special training at this meeting. Any questions can be directed to the program director.

## Sponsorship

WJRH sponsors a number of events every season, and you’re welcome to propose us ideas.
Lafayette organizations

We’re always happy to sponsor/co-sponsor events held at Lafayette College, hosted by departments and clubs/organizations. However, due to high demand, we have some policies in effect to make this process easier for both of us.

### Kinds of events we’re likely to sponsor

- Concerts / Coffeehouse
- Acacemic events/talks
- Related career panels
- Lafayette traditions (Fall Fest, Block PArty etc.)
- Other events that have music or broadcasting as a central theme

### Kinds of events we don’t usually sponsor

- “We just need a mic and a pair of speakers”
- “Please play music on the quad while we do our own unrelated activity”
- “Please give us money so that we can do our unrelated activity”
- “Please spread the word about our unrelated activity to your members / disk jockeys”
-  Large events lacking other sponsors / credibility

### Contacting us regarding events

Contact us as soon as possible but no later than 2 weeks before the planned event. We can help you think about and plan the event if you are not set on a date. Please contact the Events Director using your Lafayette email account with the following information.

- Person in Charge
- Datetime
- Location (rain location)
- Event description
- General idea of your budget
- What you expect from us

We will get back to you with additional questions. We meet on every Wednesday the school is in session. Expect a definite answer the following Wednesday.

If this is your first time seeking WJRH sponsorship, you can view an example letter.

We reserve the right to refuse sponsorship.
Community organizations
Community Events

Event though most of our Events work happens on campus, we welcome proposals to contribute to local community events. Previously, we have sponsored local concerts, performed at the Easton Farmer’s market.

Please email us details about your event no later than 3 weeks before the event. Note that we have drastically reduced staff over the summer.
Outside Media Organizations

We can help record phone interviews with faculty for broadcasting. Please email us details after confirming availability with faculty. Unfortunately we can’t facilitate introductions to anyone at Lafayette.

## Your Music

How to Get Your Music Played
Will you play my music?

WJRH is a completely freeform radio station. This means that the station gives DJs time slots and each DJ selects all the music played on his or her show. DJs may play music from their personal collection and from the radio station library. There is minimal oversight of the music that is available for DJ consideration. We have a very large record collection and a lot of CDs in racks. We put up all the music we receive in a special ‘new music’ area before archiving them, but in the end what is played is in the DJs control.
Do you even listen to what we send you?

Yeah, Jake Garber and Nicole Harry are DJs with special interest in new music. They are in charge of glance over most of the music sent to us and provide feedback. This does not mean that we will provice any feedback to you at all.

The Music Director is not responsible for listening to all music submissions.We let each individual DJ decide what to spin. DJs are free to check out your tunes whenever they want.
Do you have a medium or heavy rotation?

No. All live DJs play whatever they want. This could mean that they can rickroll you 10 times in a row.
Do you folks play unsigned bands?

Yes, unsigned bands are treated no differently than major label bands.
Could you listen to my MP3 and tell me if you like it?

We hardly have enough time to handle the quantity of tangible media as it is. We urge artists and labels to send music in a physical form. However, if you put #submission in your subject line and if it is direcly sent to us, can take a look at it.
So is there nothing I can do to get my CD played on WJRH?

Well, take a gander at our playlists, show descriptions and listen to the streams. Then determine if your music is suitable for (m)any of these shows. Contacting DJs directly is your best bet.
OK. I understand. How can we send you our awesome record?
