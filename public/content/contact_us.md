## Sponsorship

WJRH sponsors a number of events every season, and you’re welcome to propose us ideas.
Lafayette organizations

We’re always happy to sponsor/co-sponsor events held at Lafayette College, hosted by departments and clubs/organizations. However, due to high demand, we have some policies in effect to make this process easier for both of us.

### Kinds of events we’re likely to sponsor

- Concerts / Coffeehouse
- Acacemic events/talks
- Related career panels
- Lafayette traditions (Fall Fest, Block PArty etc.)
- Other events that have music or broadcasting as a central theme

### Kinds of events we don’t usually sponsor

- “We just need a mic and a pair of speakers”
- “Please play music on the quad while we do our own unrelated activity”
- “Please give us money so that we can do our unrelated activity”
- “Please spread the word about our unrelated activity to your members / disk jockeys”
-  Large events lacking other sponsors / credibility

### Contacting us regarding events

Contact us as soon as possible but no later than 2 weeks before the planned event. We can help you think about and plan the event if you are not set on a date. Please contact the Events Director using your Lafayette email account with the following information.

- Person in Charge
- Datetime
- Location (rain location)
- Event description
- General idea of your budget
- What you expect from us

We will get back to you with additional questions. We meet on every Wednesday the school is in session. Expect a definite answer the following Wednesday.

If this is your first time seeking WJRH sponsorship, you can view an example letter.

We reserve the right to refuse sponsorship.
Community organizations
Community Events

Event though most of our Events work happens on campus, we welcome proposals to contribute to local community events. Previously, we have sponsored local concerts, performed at the Easton Farmer’s market.

Please email us details about your event no later than 3 weeks before the event. Note that we have drastically reduced staff over the summer.
Outside Media Organizations

We can help record phone interviews with faculty for broadcasting. Please email us details after confirming availability with faculty. Unfortunately we can’t facilitate introductions to anyone at Lafayette.

### Your Music

Will you play my music?

WJRH is a completely freeform radio station. This means that the station gives DJs time slots and each DJ selects all the music played on his or her show. DJs may play music from their personal collection and from the radio station library. There is minimal oversight of the music that is available for DJ consideration. We have a very large record collection and a lot of CDs in racks. We put up all the music we receive in a special ‘new music’ area before archiving them, but in the end what is played is in the DJs control.

Do you even listen to what we send you?

Yeah, Jake Garber and Nicole Harry are DJs with special interest in new music. They are in charge of glance over most of the music sent to us and provide feedback. This does not mean that we will provice any feedback to you at all.

The Music Director is not responsible for listening to all music submissions.We let each individual DJ decide what to spin. DJs are free to check out your tunes whenever they want.

Do you have a medium or heavy rotation?

No. All live DJs play whatever they want. This could mean that they can rickroll you 10 times in a row.

Do you folks play unsigned bands?

Yes, unsigned bands are treated no differently than major label bands.

Could you listen to my MP3 and tell me if you like it?

We hardly have enough time to handle the quantity of tangible media as it is. We urge artists and labels to send music in a physical form. However, if you put #submission in your subject line and if it is direcly sent to us, can take a look at it.

So is there nothing I can do to get my CD played on WJRH?

Well, take a gander at our playlists, show descriptions and listen to the streams. Then determine if your music is suitable for (m)any of these shows. Contacting DJs directly is your best bet.

OK. I understand. How can we send you our awesome record?
